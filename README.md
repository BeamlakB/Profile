# Beamlak's Personal Website 
Welcome to the repository for my personal website!
This site serves as my digital portfolio — showcasing my projects, experience, and interests in machine learning, software engineering, and research.
I built this website to share my professional journey, highlight my projects, and provide an easy way for others to get in touch.
My goal is to create a simple, elegant, and responsive design that reflects both my technical and creative sides
